Here, we'll add some folders to represent a specific CIS version to use.
Each folder will contains links to adequat scripts

Ex:
debian12/
        1.1.1.1_disable_cramfs.sh ->../../bin/hardening/disable_cramfs.sh
        1.1.1.2_disable_freevxfs.sh ->../../bin/hardening/disable_freevxfs.sh
        etc.
